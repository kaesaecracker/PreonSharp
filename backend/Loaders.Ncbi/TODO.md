### ToDos for NCBI Taxonomy data source
- [x] load names.dmp as entities
- [x] load nodes.dmp as entity relations
- [ ] load images.dmp and annotate entities with images for display in frontend
- [ ] load division.dmp and annotate entities with those
- [ ] merged.dmp may be used to merge entities before loading (or may contain ids not used anymore)
- [ ] filter tags from names.dmp (e.g. "authority"), or separate those out somehow
- [ ] specify both names from names.dmp instead of one
