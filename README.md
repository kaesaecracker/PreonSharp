# PreonSharp

Inspired by https://github.com/ermshaua/preon, I wrote this partially working reimplementation in C#. 

## Structure

Main:
- PreonSharp: non-modular core
- PreonSharp.Loaders: Knowledge providers that load files from disk. 
  Demonstrates that the core does not know what a file is.
- PreonUsage: demo program

Auxiliary:
- BioCXml: library for parsing BioC files, mostly autogenerated code
- PreonBenchmarks: mostly temporary benchmarks to guide further enhancements
- PreonTests: unit tests
- PreonSharp.Fastenshtein: matching strategy using a fast Levenshtein distance implementation
- PreonSharp.Levenshtein: matching strategy using an own implementation of Levenshtein distance, to be made extensible.
